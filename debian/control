Description: Finite element multiphysics suite
 Elmer is an open source multiphysical simulation software mainly developed by
 CSC - IT Center for Science (CSC).  Elmer development was started 1995 in
 collaboration with Finnish Universities, research institutes and industry.
 After it's open source publication in 2005, the use and development of Elmer
 has become international.
 .
 Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics,
 electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are
 described by partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the Finite
 Element Method (FEM).")
